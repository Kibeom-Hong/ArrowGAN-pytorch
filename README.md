> **Abstract**: Training GANs on videos is even more sophisticated than on images because videos have a distinguished dimension: time. While recent methods designed a dedicated architecture considering time, generated videos are still far from indistinguishable from real videos. In this paper, we introduce ArrowGAN framework, where the discriminators learns to classify arrow of time as an auxiliary task and the generators tries to synthesize forward-running videos. We argue that the auxiliary task should be carefully chosen regarding the target domain. In addition, we explore categorical ArrowGAN with recent techniques in conditional image generation upon ArrowGAN framework, achieving the stateof-the-art performance on categorical video generation. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of arrow of time as a self-supervisory task, and demonstrate that all our components of categorical ArrowGAN lead to the improvement regarding video inception score and Fr√©chet video distance on three datasets: Weizmann, UCFsports, and UCF-101.
